# Predictive 30-day Mortality Modeling Using a Diverse Set of ML Methods


**Background**
Investigated a 30-day mortality patient dataset utilizing a variety of machine learning techniques: logistic regression, ridge regression, artificial neural network, random forest, gradient boosted machine, and support vector machine.

**Data**
The number of samples that are within the dataset is 3661 observations. Also, the dataset includes 1 response DAY30 (The 30 Day mortality) and 22 predictors AGE (Age in years), A65 (Age >65 years (0/1)), SEX (male=0, female=1), KILLIP (Killip class (1–4): A measure for left ventricular function), SHO (Shock: Killip class 3/4 vs. 1/2 (0/1)), DIA (Diabetes (0/1)), HYP (Hypotension: Systolic BP<100 (0/1)), HRT (Heart rate: Pulse>80 (“tachycardia,” 0/1)), ANT (Anterior infarct location (0/1)), PMI (Previous myocardial infarction (0/1)), HIG (High risk: ANT or PMI (0/1)), HEI (Height in cm), WEI (Weight in kg), SMK (Smoking (1 = never; 2 = exsmoker; 3 = current smoker)), HTN (Hypertension history (0/1)), LIP (Lipids: Hypercholesterolaemia (0/1)), PAN (Previous angina pectoris (0/1)), FAM (Family history of MI (0/1)), STE (ST elevation on ECG: Number of leads), ST4 (ST elevation on ECG: >4 leads (0/1)), TTR (Time to relief of chest pain > 1 h (0/1)), and Group (Sample number in the trial).
